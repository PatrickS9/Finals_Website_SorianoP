<h1>Sister Schools</h1>
Saint Louis School of Aurora ill, Inc. is one of the Diocesan Schools under the Diocese of Baguio. The SIster
schools are Don Bosco School of Baguio City, Saint Louis School of Pacdal, San Jose High School of La Trinidad Saint Louis School of Antamok, Itogon; Saint Louis School of Balatoc; Sacred Heart High School of Itogon, Saint Louis School of Sablan; St. Louis School-Philex, St. Theresita's School ot Kapangan, St. Paul's Academy- Sayangan, San Isidro School ofAbatan, and Immaculate Conception School of Bokod. Uriginally, these VIcariate schools were run and managed by the Belgian CICM priests and ICM Sisters from
the early 1920's up to the late 1970's when the Diocesan priests and SIHM sisters took over.

<h1>Background of Saint Aloysius Gonzaga</h1>
<br>
Saint Aloysius belonged to a family of princes, theGonzaga tamily. wheh he had his first communion, he made
  up his mind to make God his first and last love. He was thirteen years old when his father, together with his brother, took him from Italy, where he was born, to King Philip's court in Spain. James, the king's son, made Aloysius and his brother his pages.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two ycars later, Prince James died and Aloysius returned to Italy. By this time he decided to give up his royal title of prince in favor of his brother. Why? He wanted to be a prince of God. His mother consented to his choice of religious vocation but his father opposed it. His father wanted him to be a soldier and a great ruler but Aloysius wanted to be a soldier
  of God.
  <br>
  <br>
  And yet with a determined will, he finally got his father's consent and in the year 1585 on the 25th of November he entered the Jesuit Order as a novice, thus moving his first step toward his holy ambition. With the hope to be a missionary and to work among the pagans, he worked and prayed fervently and unceasingly.
  <br>
  <br>
  When he was about to be ordained as a priest in Rome, an epidemic suddenly swept the city. The Jesuits stopped their school and put up a hospital. Aloysius and the other
  seminarians helped took care of the sick. Eventually because of direct contact with the aflicted, Aloysius got the plague. Soon he was ill unto death. It was the 2Ist day of June 1591, eight days after the feast of Corpus Christi. He was 23 years
  old and had lived in the seminary for more than five years.
  <br>
  <br>
  The young saint, a model and patron of boys and young men, preferred to be a religious poor rather than to
  enjoy a luxurious life of a prince. Teenagers of modern times certainly do need Aloysius badly as a model and a guide to the ways of Christ.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the year of 1726, Pope Benedict XIII proclaimed Aloysius Gonzaga a saint, thus the Holy Church proclaimed publicly the marvelous heroism ofAloysius (Louis) Gonzaga
  during the brief 23 years that he graced this earth, the heroism and the cooperation with God's grace by which he merited the eternal friendship of God. Having served the world, he found heaven; having left his kinsmen and friends, he found God.
